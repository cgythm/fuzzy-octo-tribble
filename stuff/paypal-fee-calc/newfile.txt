What is black magic? I don't know how to deal with this black magic stuff, it's wicked
scary but I can deal with it. It's pretty cool that I typed set wm=45 in command mode
<esc> mode and now there is a warping margin of 45 characters. this sort of black
magic basically inserts, for me,  a new line character every 45 characters, creating
line breaks happen before 45 characters appear without me having to press enter. this
is wickedly black magic.

okay, some sample code
void pump(list_l *pump_src, black ){
